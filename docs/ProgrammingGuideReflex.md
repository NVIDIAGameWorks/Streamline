
Streamline - Reflex
=======================

>The focus of this guide is on using Streamline to integrate Reflex into an application.  For more information about Reflex itself, please visit the [NVIDIA Developer Reflex Page](https://developer.nvidia.com/performance-rendering-tools/reflex)

Version 2.2.1
=======

Here is an overview list of sub-features in the Reflex plugin:

| Feature | GPU Vendor | GPU HW | Driver Version | Support Check | Key Setting/Marker |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Reflex Low Latency** | NVDA only | GeForce 900 Series and newer | 456.38+ | `sl::ReflexSettings::lowLatencyAvailable` | `sl::ReflexConstants::mode` |
| **Auto-Configure Reflex Analyzer** | NVDA only | GeForce 900 Series and newer | 521.60+ | `sl::ReflexSettings::flashIndicatorDriverControlled` | `sl::ReflexMarker::eReflexMarkerTriggerFlash` |
| **Frame Rate Limiter** | NVDA only | All | All | Always | `sl::ReflexConstants::frameLimitUs` |
| **PC Latency Stats** | All | All | All | Always | `sl::ReflexMarker::eReflexMarkerPCLatencyPing` |

> **NOTE:**
> The sub-features are distinct to each other without any cross-dependencies. Everything is abstracted within the plugin and is transparent to the application. The application should not explicitly check for GPU HW, vendor, and driver version. The application should do everything the same regardless of sub-feature support and enablement. The only 2 exceptions are Reflex UI and Reflex Flash Indicator (RFI). The application must disable Reflex UI based on `sl::ReflexSettings::lowLatencyAvailable`. And the application must not send `sl::ReflexMarker::eReflexMarkerTriggerFlash` when `sl::ReflexSettings::flashIndicatorDriverControlled` is false.

### 1.0 INITIALIZE AND SHUTDOWN

Call `slInit` as early as possible (before any dxgi/d3d11/d3d12 APIs are invoked)

```cpp

#include <sl.h>
#include <sl_reflex.h>

sl::Preferences pref{};
pref.showConsole = true; // for debugging, set to false in production
pref.logLevel = sl::eLogLevelDefault;
pref.pathsToPlugins = {}; // change this if Streamline plugins are not located next to the executable
pref.numPathsToPlugins = 0; // change this if Streamline plugins are not located next to the executable
pref.pathToLogsAndData = {}; // change this to enable logging to a file
pref.logMessageCallback = myLogMessageCallback; // highly recommended to track warning/error messages in your callback
pref.applicationId = myId; // Provided by NVDA, required if using NGX components (DLSS 2/3)
pref.engineType = myEngine; // If using UE or Unity
pref.engineVersion = myEngineVersion; // Optional version
pref.projectId = myProjectId; // Optional project id
if(SL_FAILED(res, slInit(pref)))
{
    // Handle error, check the logs
    if(res == sl::Result::eErrorDriverOutOfDate) { /* inform user */}
    // and so on ...
}
```

For more details please see [preferences](ProgrammingGuide.md#221-preferences)

Call `slShutdown()` before destroying dxgi/d3d11/d3d12/vk instances, devices and other components in your engine.

```cpp
if(SL_FAILED(res, slShutdown()))
{
    // Handle error, check the logs
}
```

#### 1.1 SET THE CORRECT DEVICE

Once the main device is created call `slSetD3DDevice` or `slSetVulkanInfo`:

```cpp
if(SL_FAILED(res, slSetD3DDevice(nativeD3DDevice)))
{
    // Handle error, check the logs
}
```

### 2.0 CHECK IF REFLEX IS SUPPORTED

As soon as SL is initialized, you can check if Reflex is available for the specific adapter you want to use:

```cpp
Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<IDXGIFactory> factory;
if (SUCCEEDED(CreateDXGIFactory(__uuidof(IDXGIFactory), (void**)&factory)))
{
    Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<IDXGIAdapter> adapter{};
    uint32_t i = 0;
    while (factory->EnumAdapters(i, &adapter) != DXGI_ERROR_NOT_FOUND)
    {
        DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC desc{};
        if (SUCCEEDED(adapter->GetDesc(&desc)))
        {
            sl::AdapterInfo adapterInfo{};
            adapterInfo.deviceLUID = (uint8_t*)&desc.AdapterLuid;
            adapterInfo.deviceLUIDSizeInBytes = sizeof(LUID);
            if (SL_FAILED(result, slIsFeatureSupported(sl::kFeatureReflex, adapterInfo)))
            {
                // Requested feature is not supported on the system, fallback to the default method
                switch (result)
                {
                    case sl::Result::eErrorOSOutOfDate:         // inform user to update OS
                    case sl::Result::eErrorDriverOutOfDate:     // inform user to update driver
                    case sl::Result::eErrorNoSupportedAdapter:  // cannot use this adapter (older or non-NVDA GPU etc)
                    // and so on ...
                };
            }
            else
            {
                // Feature is supported on this adapter!
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The Reflex plugin includes two distinct functionalities: Reflex Low Latency and PC Latency (PCL) Stats. While the support for Reflex Low Latency is dependent on the GPU hardware, vendor, and driver version, **PCL Stats is supported on all GPU hardwares, vendors, and driver versions**. The plugin handles all such abstractions; As long as `sl::kFeatureReflex` is supported, the application should always make the same `slReflexSetMarker` and `slReflexSleep` calls without any explicit GPU hardware, vendor, and driver version checks.

### 3.0 CHECK REFLEX STATE AND CAPABILITIES

To find out what latency modes are available, currently active or to obtain the latest latency stats you can do the following:

```cpp

// Using helpers from sl_reflex.h

sl::ReflexState state{};
if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexGetState(state)))
{
    // Handle error here, check the logs
}
if(state.lowLatencyAvailable)
{
    //
    // Reflex Low Latency is available, on NVDA hardware this would be done through Reflex.
    //
    // The application can show the Reflex Low Latency UI. (Otherwise hide/disable the UI.)
    // This is for UI only. Do everything else the same, even when this is false.
    //
}
if(state.flashIndicatorDriverControlled)
{
    //
    // Reflex Flash Indicator (RFI) is controlled by the driver. This means
    // the application should always check for left mouse button clicks and
    // send the trigger flash markers accordingly. The driver will decide
    // whether to show the RFI on screen based on user preference.
    //
}
```

### 4.0 SET REFLEX OPTIONS

To configure Reflex please do the following:

```cpp

// Using helpers from sl_reflex.h

sl::ReflexOptions reflexOptions = {};
reflexOptions.mode = eReflexModeLowLatency; // to disable Reflex simply set this to off
reflexOptions.frameLimitUs = myFrameLimit; // See docs for ReflexConstants
reflexOptions.useMarkersToOptimize = myUseMarkers; // See docs for ReflexConstants
if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSetOptions(reflexOptions)))
{
    // Handle error here, check the logs
}
```

> **NOTE:**
> To turn off Reflex set `sl::ReflexOptions.mode` to `sl::ReflexMode::eOff`. `slReflexSetMarker` must always be called even when Reflex low-latency mode is Off. These markers are also used by PCL Stats to measure latency.

> **NOTE:**
> `slReflexSetOptions` needs to be called at least once, even when Reflex Low Latency is Off and there is no Reflex UI. If options do not change there is no need to call this method every frame.

### 5.0 ADD SL REFLEX TO THE RENDERING PIPELINE

Call `slReflexSetMarker` or `slReflexSleep` at the appropriate location where Reflex markers need to be injected or where your application should sleep.

Here is some pseudo code:

```cpp

// Using helpers from sl_reflex.h

// Make sure Reflex is enabled (Reflex is ALWAYS available at least as latency tracker)
if(useReflex) 
{
    // Mark the section where specific activity is happening.
    //
    // Here for example we will make the simulation code.
    //
    
    // Starting new frane, grab handle from SL
    sl::FrameToken* currentFrame{};
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slGetNewFrameToken(&currentFrame))
    {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Simulation start
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSetMarker(sl::ReflexMarker::eSimulationStart, *currentFrame)))
    {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Simulation code goes here

    // Simulation end
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSetMarker(sl::ReflexMarker::eSimulationEnd, *currentFrame)))
    {
        // Handle error
    }   
}

// When checking for custom low latency messages inside the Windows message loop
//
if(useReflex && reflexState.statsWindowMessage == msgId) 
{
    // Reflex ping based on custom message

    // First scenario, using current frame
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSetMarker(sl::ReflexMarker::ePCLatencyPing, *currentFrame)))
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    
    // Second scenario, sending ping BEFORE simulation started, need to advance to the next frame
    sl::FrameToken* nextFrame{};
    auto nextIndex = *currentFrame + 1;
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slGetNewFrameToken(&nextFrame, &nextIndex))
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSetMarker(sl::ReflexMarker::ePCLatencyPing, *nextFrame)))
    {
        // Handle error
    }
}

// When your application should sleep to achieve optimal low-latency mode
//
if(useReflex) 
{
    // Sleep
    if(SL_FAILED(res, slReflexSleep(*currentFrame)))
    {
        // Handle error
    }
}

```

### 6.0 PCL STATS

PCL Stats enables real time measurement of per-frame PC latency (PCL) during gameplay​. E2E system latency = PCL + peripheral latency + display latency​. And PCL = input sampling latency + simulation start to present + present to displayed.

Windows messages with ID == `sl::ReflexState::statsWindowMessage` are sent to the application periodically. The time this ping message is sent is recorded and is used to measure the latency between the simulated input and the application picking up the input. This is the input sampling latency.

Typically, the application's message pump would process keyboard and mouse input messages into a queue to be read in the upcoming frame. On seeing the ping message, the application must either call `slReflexSetMarker` for `sl::ReflexMarker::ePCLatencyPing` to send the ping marker right away, or put it in the queue, or set a flag for the next simulation to send the ping marker.

> **NOTE:**
> The exact timing of the ping marker does not matter. It is the frame index parameter that identify which frame picks up the simulated input. For example, since the frame index is usually incremented at simulation start, in the case of the ping marker being sent at message pump before simulation start, use current frame index +1.

### 7.0 HOW TO TRANSITION FROM NVAPI REFLEX TO SL REFLEX

Existing Reflex integrations can be easily converted to use SL Reflex by following these steps:

* Remove NVAPI from your application
* Remove `reflexstats.h` from your application
* There is no longer any need to provide a native D3D/VK device when making Reflex calls - SL takes care of that, hence making the integrations easier
* `NvAPI_D3D_SetSleepMode` is replaced with [set reflex options](#40-set-reflex-constants)
* `NvAPI_D3D_GetSleepStatus` is replaced with [get reflex state](#30-check-reflex-settings-and-capabilities) - see `sl::ReflexState::lowLatencyAvailable`
* `NvAPI_D3D_GetLatency` is replaced with [get reflex state](#30-check-reflex-settings-and-capabilities) - see `sl::ReflexReport`
* `NvAPI_D3D_SetLatencyMarker` is replaced with `slReflexSetMarker`
* `NvAPI_D3D_Sleep` is replaced with `slReflexSleep`
* `NVSTATS*` calls are handled automatically by SL Reflex plugin and are GPU agnostic
* `NVSTATS_IS_PING_MSG_ID` is replaced with [get reflex options](#30-check-reflex-settings-and-capabilities) - see `sl::ReflexOptions::statsWindowMessage`
